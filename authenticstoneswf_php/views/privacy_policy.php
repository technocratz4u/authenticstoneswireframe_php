						customer information generally is one of the transferred business
						assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
						pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer

						other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit
						risk reduction. Due to the existing regulatory environment, we
						cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other
						personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise
						described in this Privacy Policy. Obviously, however, this does
						not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing
						personally identifiable information from customers for commercial
						purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy

					<h2>What About Cookies?</h2>

					<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to
						your computer&rsquo;s hard drive through your Web browser to
						enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide
						features. Authenticstones.com uses persistent cookies to identify
						members after their first visit. These cookies remain on the hard
						drive of a PC and allow a member to enter the site without having
						to log in on every visit. To access any secure areas such as your
						account information, you must still enter your password. You can
						choose to disable cookies by deselecting that option under your
						browser preferences. When you disable cookies, you can browse the
						Authenticstones.com store, but you cannot access your membership
						information or make purchases. Disabling cookies can also
						interrupt audio and cause breaks in navigation. When becoming a
						Authenticstones.com member, you can choose whether or not to
						accept the Authenticstones.com persistent cookie. Without the
						persistent cookie, a user can still shop the Authenticstones.com
						store.</p>

					<h2>Usage Tracking</h2>

					<h2>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2>

					<p>
						We work to protect the security of your information during
						transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
						encrypts information you input. <br /> . No employee of
						Authenticstones.com will know your entire credit card number. Of
						course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the
						appropriate credit card company during order processing. In case
						of refund, we use only last five digits of your credit card to do
						the refund and we do not keep any of your credit card information
						on Authenticstones.com server. <br /> . It is important for you
						to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to
						your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared
						computer. You are responsible for all actions taken with your User
						ID and password, including fees charged to your account. Therefore
						we do not recommend that you disclose your Authenticstones.com
						password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID
						and password or your personal information with third parties, you
						are responsible for all actions taken with your account and
						therefore you should review that third party&rsquo;s privacy
						policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose
						substantial control over your personal information and may be
						subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
						Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason,
						you should immediately change your password.
